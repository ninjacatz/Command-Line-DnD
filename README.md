A D&D command line program which allows you to create a character using a "sheet" (a '.txt' file) and play that character with basic functions. Based on DnD 5th Edition ruleset from the 2014 Player's Handbook.

Use the blank sheet to create a new character (or use the pre-made character Broda) to test out the program. 

Player functionality is self-explanatory within the program.
