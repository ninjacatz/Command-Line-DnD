A humble and devout Acolyte of the Temple of Truesilver in the Dwarven city of Bhal Thandhor, Broda Balderk has received a vision from the deity Berronar Truesilver while in worship. He is to meet someone who (insert characteristic) and is told he will go on an important and life-changing quest with that person.
